# Capstone 2: Build Your Own Linter

In this project, I've built a Ruby linter for beginners, providing feedback for 5 of the most common Ruby errors:

1. Trailing white space
2. Extra empty line
3. Space around operators
4. Indentation
5. Empty line after "end" keyword

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your machine via the green "code" button at the top, or open your Terminal/Command Prompt and run git clone.
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run linter.rb --(yourfile) to check your code for linter errors.
