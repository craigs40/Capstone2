# Capstone 2: Build Your Own Linter

In this project, I've built a simplified Ruby linter for beginners, providing feedback for 5 of the most common Ruby errors:

1. Trailing white space
2. Extra empty line
3. Space around operators
4. Indentation
5. Empty line after "end" keyword

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your machine via the green "code" button at the top, or open your Terminal/Command Prompt and run 'git clone' with this repository's url.
2. Navigate to the bin folder.
3. Run linter.rb to check the test_file.txt for linter errors.

## Testing the code:
1. In order to run rspec successfully in this project, open check_error.rb and change the file path in the @file variable from ('../test_file.txt') to ('./test_file.txt')
2. In the Terminal/Command Prompt, navigate to the parent directory of this project. (Capstone2 folder)
3. Run rspec
